# Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction Dataset
maktabkhooneh - Learning machine learning with Python

In this project, you have to predict whether a patient has a low chance of a heart attack or a high chance, according to the medical information of a patient, which is fully described below?! The data is saved in heart.csv file.

The dataset provided has the following columns of multiple-choice data:

- age : Age of the patient

- sex : Sex of the patient

- exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

- ca: number of major vessels (0-3)

- cp : Chest Pain type chest pain type:
  * Value 1: typical angina
  * Value 2: atypical angina
  * Value 3: non-anginal pain
  * Value 4: asymptomatic

- trtbps : resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)

- chol : cholestoral in mg/dl fetched via BMI sensor

- fbs : (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)

- rest_ecg : resting electrocardiographic results

  * Value 0: normal
  * Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
  * Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
- thalach : maximum heart rate achieved

- thall : Thalium Stress Test result ~ (0,3)

- oldpeak : Previous peak

- slp : Slope

- target : 0= less chance of heart attack 1= more chance of heart attack
